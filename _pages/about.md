## About me

I recently completed my PhD as a Doctoral Fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/).  
My work focuses on explainability for large language models, graph neural networks, and multimodal architectures, with applications in health, climate, and social systems.

My main interests include:

- LLM explainability — model-agnostic XAI, post-hoc evaluation, linguistic perturbations  
- Deep learning on graphs — GNN explainability, network analysis, graph theory  
- Multimodal explainability — image, text, and graph representations  
- Generative AI for molecular design and drug discovery  
- AI applications in health, climate, and social networks

I worked within the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) and the [IVIA Lab](https://ivia.ethz.ch/) led by Prof. [Mennatallah El-Assady](https://el-assady.com/).  
Through co-supervised projects, I also collaborated with the [Social Networks Lab](https://sn.ethz.ch/) and the [Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science](https://iac.ethz.ch/).

Before my PhD, I studied at École Polytechnique (computer science & mathematics) and completed a Master’s degree in Environmental Sciences at ETH Zürich.

In parallel, I contributed to several applied research projects:
- Microsoft Research Cambridge — explainability for molecular prediction  
- Meta AI Paris — improving decoder architectures for compression retrieval  
- Crowther Lab, ETH — species detection with GNNs and optimal transport  
- Earth Institute, Columbia University — wildfire prediction  
- DAIKIN Osaka — software engineering  
- IFCEN Zhuhai — teaching assistant

Outside research, I love exploring new places, swimming, hiking, and skiing.
